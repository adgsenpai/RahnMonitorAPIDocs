## What is MonitorGPT
Our MonitorGPT AI assistant elevates Enhanced Due Diligence, integrating internet connectivity to meticulously compile and refine in-depth analyses of your specified high-risk search results.

- Access current research, concisely summarized for efficient reporting.
- Benefit from corroborative links that bolster outcome accuracy, verifiability, and reliability.
- Receive bespoke, detailed investigative reports on specific individuals and entities.
- Optimize your time and resources by deploying AI-driven solutions tailored to your needs.

### How It Works

Our MonitorGPT AI assistant harnesses sophisticated technology, seamlessly blending smart systems with cutting-edge capabilities to revolutionize Enhanced Due Diligence. Here's a breakdown of its operational framework:

1. **Integration of Smart Systems:** At its core, MonitorGPT leverages advanced systems that incorporate You.com's document searching prowess with robust internet scraping techniques. This integration ensures comprehensive data harvesting, pulling relevant information from a myriad of online sources and databases.

2. **Enhanced Data Processing:** After gathering data, the AI utilizes a customized version of GPT-4, tailored specifically for our application. This bespoke AI model is designed to handle an extensive token input of up to 32,000 tokens, allowing for the analysis of large datasets and complex queries with unparalleled depth and precision.

3. **Encoding and Analysis:** The collated data undergoes sophisticated encoding, processed through our modified GPT-4 model. This step involves deep learning algorithms and natural language processing to distill and synthesize information, ensuring detailed and contextually relevant insights.

4. **Outcome Delivery:** The result is a set of detailed, actionable insights presented in a user-friendly format. Users benefit from up-to-date research summaries, supporting links for validation, and customized reports tailored to their specific investigative needs, all aimed at enhancing decision-making processes and operational efficiency.

Through this intricate orchestration of technologies, MonitorGPT sets a new standard in AI-assisted due diligence, empowering users with superior intelligence and analysis capabilities.

### Advanced Options

In advanced options, you have two distinct choices that can influence both the accuracy of the results and the cost associated with the AI query. Here's a breakdown of each option:

- Use documents
- Use previous messages

#### Overview of LLM AI Pricing Structure

In Large Language Model (LLM) systems, pricing is directly linked to the volume of text processed. Specifically:

- The greater the amount of text input or output, the higher the incurred cost.
- Conversely, lesser text volume results in reduced expenses. 

This pricing mechanism emphasizes the cost dependency on data quantity within LLM operations.


#### Use Documents
When you opt to use documents, you are essentially allowing the AI to access a broader set of data, which can enhance the accuracy and relevance of the outputs. However, this comes with a higher cost due to increased resource utilization. The key advantage here is the depth of analysis and precision, especially valuable in scenarios requiring detailed background checks or comprehensive information gathering.

For instance, if you're investigating a sanctioned individual, using documents enables the AI to delve into extensive online repositories, fetching pertinent details from legal documents, media reports, and other relevant sources. This ensures a thorough and nuanced understanding of the subject matter.

#### Use Previous Messages
Alternatively, leveraging previous messages is a more cost-effective strategy that reuses existing interactions as a knowledge base for the AI. While this approach can reduce expenses, it might not offer the same level of detail or up-to-date information compared to using documents.

This method is particularly effective for ongoing conversations or contexts where historical interactions provide sufficient background. It ensures consistency and continuity in the AI's responses, drawing upon accumulated insights from prior exchanges.

In summary, your choice between using documents or previous messages hinges on the specific requirements of your query: depth and breadth of information versus cost-efficiency and contextual continuity.

### Asking a question to MonitorGPT
